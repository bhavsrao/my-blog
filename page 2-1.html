            Moris [moʁis]), officially the Republic of Mauritius (French: République de Maurice; Mauritian Creole: Repiblik Moris), is an Indian Ocean island country, approximately 2,000 kilometres (1,100 nautical miles) off the southeastern coast of East Africa, east of Madagascar. It includes the main island (also called Mauritius), as well as Rodrigues, Agaléga and St. Brandon.[11][12] The islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues, along with nearby Réunion (a French overseas department), are part of the Mascarene Islands. The main island of Mauritius, where most of the population is concentrated, hosts the capital and largest city, Port Louis. The country spans 2,040 square kilometres (790 sq mi) and has an exclusive economic zone covering 2,300,000 square kilometres (670,000 square nautical miles).[13]

            It is believed Arab sailors first discovered the uninhabited island around 975 naming it Dina Arobi.[14][15] Portuguese sailors visited the uninhabited island in 1507 with the island appearing with the Portuguese names Cirne or Do-Cerne on early Portuguese maps.[16] A Dutch fleet, under the command of Admiral Van Warwyck landed at what is now Grand Port and took possession of the island in 1598, renaming the then uninhabited islands after Maurice, Prince of Orange. A succession of short-lived Dutch attempts at permanent settlement took place over a century with the aim of exploiting the local ebony forests, establishing a consistent sugar and arrack production using cane plant cuttings imported from Java along with over three hundred Malagasy slaves, before abandoning their efforts.</p>
